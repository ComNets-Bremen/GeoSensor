\chapter{Overview of the Digital Appendix}
The digital appendix included in this thesis contains the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item The compiled Android application software which can be sideloaded onto compatible Android devices.
\item The source code and the build project for the Android application software. The software was developed and compiled using Android Studio.
\item The source code for the embedded software run on the Arduino in the transducer.
\item Test data recorded regarding the energy consumption and the Matlab live scripts used to generate the plots used in the thesis.
\item Test data recorded regarding the position accuracy and the Matlab live scripts used to generate the plots and maps used in the thesis.
\item Test data recorded in the field test, the Matlab live scripts used to generate the plots used in the thesis and the Excel spreadsheet used for the bar graph plot.
\item The test software used to test the protocol compliance of the Android app.
\item The fritzing (see \cite{fritzing}) files used to generate the circuit diagram and breadboard graphics.
\item The CAD files (for Autodesk Fusion 360, see \cite{f360}) used for the demonstration devices case.
\item A list of the measured properties understood and translated in the Android app.
\end{itemize}
