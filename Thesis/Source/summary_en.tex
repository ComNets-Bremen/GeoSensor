  This thesis discusses the design of a system to acquire geotagged measure data. The system is based on the Arduino platform used to build a transducer device to which the sensors are connected and the Android platform which is used to run application software to visualize, store and export the data. On the Arduino platform, a software was developed allowing the integration of different sensors according to the needs of the user. The transducer device and the Android device running the application software use a Bluetooth communication channel to transfer the measured data. On the Android device, the application software can show the data received in a list and on a street map. The data can be written into a comma separated values file and exported to other apps or transferred to a personal computer.
